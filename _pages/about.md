> **Fields of Interest**: Health Economics, Labor Economics, & Applied Econometrics


I am a third year Economics Ph.D. Student at the [Universtity of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/class/economics/) specializing in health and labor economics and applied econometrics. My research investigates spillovers and consequences of health care policy and technological change. I also study the effect of labor market dynamics on occupational choice. I focus on building novel and innovative datasets for econometric analysis. Several of my current and past projects have utilizied web-scrapping, machine learning, and natural language processesing.

I will be a Doctoral Researcher at the [University of Houston - Hobby School of Public Affairs](https://uh.edu/hobby/) during the 2023-2024 academic year. I was previously a Research Assistant at the [Humana Integrated Health System Sciences Institute](https://uh.edu/medicine/research/humana-institute/) in collaboration with the [Tilman J.
