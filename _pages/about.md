I am a fifth-year Economics Ph.D. Candidate at the [Universtity of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/class/economics/), specializing in labor, health, and applied econometrics. My research includes projects on the returns to elite sports programs, the gender gap in the market for superstars, and career decisions in Thai village economies. I’ve had the opportunity to present my work at various conferences, including Texas Camp Econometrics and the Texas Applied Microeconomics Workshop. I enjoy working with innovative datasets, often utilizing web scraping, machine learning, and natural language processing techniques to enhance econometric analysis.

Currently, I am a Doctoral Researcher at the [University of Houston - Hobby School of Public Affairs](https://uh.edu/hobby/) during the 2023-2025 academic years. I was previously a Research Assistant at the [Humana Integrated Health System Sciences Institute](https://uh.edu/medicine/research/humana-institute/) in collaboration with the [Tilman J. Fertitta College of Medicine](https://uh.edu/medicine).
