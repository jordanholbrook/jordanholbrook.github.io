[Evaluating Predictors of Participation in Telephone-Base Social Connectedness Interventions for Older Adults: A Dual Machine-Learning and Regression Approach ](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/23337214231201204) Gerontology & Geriatric Medicine, 2023
 
> Social isolation is a well-documented contributor to poor mental and physical health, and interventions promoting social connectedness have been associated with various health benefits. This study examined predictors of participation in a telephone-based social connectedness intervention for socially isolated older adults. Data were obtained from a social-connectedness intervention that paired college students with Houston-area, community-dwelling adults aged 65â€‰years and older and enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans. We combined machine learning and regression techniques to identify significant predictors of program participation. The following machine-learning methods were implemented: (1) k-nearest neighbors, (2) decision tree and ensembles of decision trees, (3) gradient-boosted decision tree, and (4) random forest. The primary outcome was a binary flag indicating participation in the telephone-based social-connectedness intervention. The most predictive variables in the ML models, with scores corresponding to the 90th percentile or greater, were included in the regression analysis. The predictive ability of each model showed high discriminative power, with test accuracies greater than 95%. Our findings suggest that telephone-based social-connectedness interventions appeal to individuals with disabilities, depression, arthritis, and higher risk scores. scores. Recognizing features that predict participation in social-connectedness programs is the first step to increasing reach and fostering patient engagement.

[Estimating the effect of focused donor registration efforts on the number of organ donors](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33147294/)

> Waiting times for organs in the United States are long and vary widely across regions. Donor registration can increase the number of potential donors, but its effect on the actual number of organ transplants depends upon several factors. First among these factors is that deceased donor organ donation requires both that death occur in a way making recovery possible and that authorization to recover organs is obtained. We estimate the potential donor death rate and donor authorization rate conditional on potential donor death by donor registration status for each state and for key demographic groups. With this information, we then develop a simple measure of the value of a new donor registration. This combined measure using information on donor authorization rates and potential death rates varies widely across  states and groups, suggesting that focusing registration efforts on high-value groups and locations can significantly increase the overall number of donors. Targeting high-value states raises 26.7 percent more donors than a uniform, nationwide registration effort. Our estimates can also be used to assess alternative, but complemtary, policies such as protocols to improve authorization rates for non-registered potential donors.
